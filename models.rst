A simple 2-key keypad. This was previously the "no bells and whistles" model, but now features a bottom-mounted RGB LED that adds some RGB underglow to the keypad!  The side button functions as escape and is also used to change LED modes and the color of the keys on the "custom" LED mode.

A 2-key keypad that uses two capacitive metal pads instead of switches, which results in faster key presses (by removing key travel) and a slimmer keypad. It features LED modes specifically rewritten for this model and a side button that is... a screw? The side screw is just like the two top keys and will press the mapped key when touched (escape by default.)

Unlike the non-touch models, all configuration of the keypad can be done using a program like Termite and all settings will be saved to the keypad. This frees up the side button to function as a regular key and it can be remapped just like the top buttons.

MegaTouch Keypad

A larger version of the 2K touch keypad. It features 60% larger touch pads (1 1/4" squares) with the same gap as the normal model, so it's great whether you just want a larger touch area or you play with your index+ring fingers! It's still just as slim at only 12 mm tall and is just as big as it needs to be to accommodate the touch pads. The side screw still functions as a capacitive button and is mapped to Escape by default, but can be easily remapped to something like ~ for quick restart. Configuration of LED modes and brightness can be done through the software remapper.

A fancier version of the basic model that features not only the bottom-mounted LED, but also an RGB LED under each key. This makes for much brighter and more prominent lighting effects. The side button functions as escape and is also used to change LED modes, brightness, and the colors of the keys on the "custom" LED mode.

Looking for something slimmer, quieter, more portable, or all three? This 4-key keypad primarily for Mania and Taiko uses two capacitive pads instead of switches, which results in faster key presses (by eliminating key travel) and a slimmer design. It features LED modes specifically rewritten for this model and a side button that is... a screw? The side screw is just like the two top keys and will press the mapped key when touched (escape by default.)

A keypad made for 5K and 7K osu!Mania. This keypad features seven LEDs for interesting LED modes and full NKRO. The bottom key uses a 2x width angled keycap for better ergonomics. There is also a multi-function key (this is the same as the side button on my other models) that can be used to either configure your keypad or as a simple escape key.

By popular request, I made a keypad focused less on crazy lights and more on people that want the ability to quickly switch between button mappings. This model features not only the ability to map each key to up to 3 keys, but also six "pages" of mappings that you can change by holding the side button and pressing one of the six keys. It also has a single RGB LED to show the current page.

Future Tone Controller
**********************
.. image:: https://img0.etsystatic.com/204/0/10408775/il_fullxfull.1360528126_hpn6.jpg

This is the small controller I made for Hatsune Miku: Project Diva Future Tone for PS4. There is a mode select button on the front of the controller that allows you to switch between DS4 and arcade mode. DS4 mode maps the buttons to the standard DS4 layout and arcade mode maps the keys in a horizontal layout like you'd get on the arcade cabinet. This makes hold notes a lot more natural wihout sacrificing speed since the arrow buttons are all adjacent to their corresponding buttons. When the mode is changed, the LEDs change color to match the corresponding layout.
