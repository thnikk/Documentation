# Documentation for all keypads on shop.thnikk.moe

## Goals
- [x] Clean up anything that adds confusion (old switch changing guide since I don't even sell it anymore)
- [x] Update pictures for all models to match the shop
- [x] Add page for fightboard and sections for controllers (osu, fighting game)
- [ ] Update info for osu keypads when code is finished to reflect changes
- [ ] Look into updating python (this may be on GitHub's end)
